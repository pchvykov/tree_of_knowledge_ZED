Generating forces


ToDo:
+Why disconnected visNodes sometimes? (Biimpri - sylibr - bitri)
Effective connectivity - include horizontal
+Gravity - quadratic or quartic? Size-dependent?
Zooming in: children whom this is one of 2 most important parents?
+Panning at large zoom - redo zoom in calculation
Change graph weights

+possibility to adjust newly created nodes/links
undo/redo stack on server operations (https://github.com/JackAdams/meteor-undo-redo)
+Shift-enter updates DB but not content popup
link: implies in most cases
highlighting links on rollover - go further
highlighting nodes on rollover - all by color?
Optimize tick-function for speed
chargeDistance??
Make sure all types are correct when going from edit popup to DB
Check parameters: symmetrization of connMx, rounding of weak eff links, 
Ctrl+ +/-  - makes unoriented links oriented
(Only in Meteor 1.6 - Mongo3.4) $graphLookup, $aggregate, indexing?

+fix gravity
+Link style changing on type change - immediate
+resize tooltips
+Ctrl + [+/-] - resize nodes
+Ctrl + O / R - orient link
+Ctrl + Up/Down - change type
+Select node/link on creation 
+Make example links oriented by default
+Set default link weight based on node importance
+Default links to oriented in general(?)
Make "related" links easier to catch
+Small nodes force away from center??
-orienting links shouldn't change their length (currently makes them longer)
add Link repulsion? (link-node repulsion?)
"related" links weaker than theorems
+highlight child and parent nodes

overall styling
images support
nodes fixing?
zoom behavior (show/hide nodes)

Not ToDo:
node size adjust with Ctrl-zoom: non-integer size values are confusing (can fix), updating DB is confusing (at force.end), need to disable zoom behavior (not sure how)




Launching online:
(already good now) - remove the local mrt:mathjax and MathJax installations - let it use latest MathJax code directly from their server.

Thoughts----------------------------------------------------------
Type of node determined by:
Graph structure: assumption
Link label: example
Node label: definition, empirical, concept

Tooltips pros/cons:
			pro				con
-meteor lookback	simple, mathjax			only 1, not smooth
-SVG text		smooth move/zoom		no mathjax, must resize
-foreign div		mathjax, easy styling		must update

pros: Creating new collection ----v---- name labels in one collection
clean and complete seperation
if anything goes wrong, delete coll
faster publish
					meteor-friendly
					easy to combine trees


Marketing:--------------
-a generalization of books (books are a special case of this - with linear tree)
